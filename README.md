### Research paper link: http://thedesignengineering.com/index.php/DE/article/view/5761
### Developed a project using Python focusing on analyzing tweets according to different parameters such as most common words, negative words, positive words, hashtags, and compatibility with sentiments and formulated Multiclass Classification models. Obtained highest accuracy of 80.99% using stochastic gradient descent model to predict sentiments for unknown tweets. This paper is focused on identifying and performing sentiment analysis of 41,000 tweets related to COVID-19. This classification helped us understand how social media has exposed users to misinformation and negative sentiments, impacting their decisions to receive health services or medical treatments. As a second author of the technical research paper, 'Covid-19 Tweet Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning models, presented it in the International Conference on Innovative Engineering-intelligent Systems (ICISI) and this paper was later published in Designing Engineering Toronto ISSN: 0011-9342 (Scopus Indexed).
